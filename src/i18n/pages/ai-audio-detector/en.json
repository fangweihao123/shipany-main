    "title": "AI Audio Detector",
    "description": "Use the ai audio detector to screen voiceovers, podcasts, or customer calls before they go live. It listens for spectral fingerprints, rhythm irregularities, and metadata mismatches that reliably signal synthetic speech while preserving nuance about human performance. Our team designed the workflow for editors, compliance reviewers, and platform moderators who need a trustworthy verdict without sacrificing turnaround time.",

    "title": "Upload Audio to Verify Authenticity",
    "description": "Upload any snippet up to ninety seconds and put the ai audio detector to work with a layered inspection pipeline that compares timbre, transcript structure, and device fingerprints in seconds. The overview card walks through confidence scoring, highlights, and recommended follow-up steps so your team can implement decisions with clarity. Every analysis is logged with timezone-aware timestamps, user notes, and retention settings that map directly to enterprise governance policies.",
    "tech_description": "Behind the interface, our detection stack triangulates evidence across spectral centroid evolution, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and phoneme duration modeling. Instead of chasing a single heuristic, the system fuses outputs from proprietary neural nets, open-source benchmarks, and statistical baselines so biases remain visible. Confidence bands adapt as more audio from a source is evaluated, helping you understand whether a change is due to creative direction, microphone hardware, or an external manipulator. Detailed latency metrics and usage dashboards let platform teams tune capacity before traffic surges.",
    "use_cases": "Broadcast companies rely on the workflow to confirm syndicated segments, while agencies validate influencer campaigns before launch. Compliance teams review voice agents for regulated disclosures, and risk officers compare witness testimony against verified baselines. Product teams even plug the analytics into feature flags to automatically halt suspicious uploads, keeping community standards intact without staff burnout."

Our ai audio detector interprets subtle cues inside a waveform, from impulsive noise residues to compression side effects, and contextualizes them against vast libraries of verified material.",
        "When the ai audio detector flags a suspicious passage, the dashboard guides you through spectral snapshots, transcribed language markers, and a concise risk rubric that clarifies why human voices and synthetic clones diverge. Because the ai audio detector also records provenance metadata, you can hand stakeholders a transparent chain of custody that survives audits.",

        "The ai audio detector supports granular tagging, letting you label clips by campaign, speaker, or licensing territory so investigations stay organized and searchable. As a result, analysts can surface anomalies in minutes, collaborate through shared notes, and export reports that satisfy auditors, legal counsel, and security teams simultaneously."

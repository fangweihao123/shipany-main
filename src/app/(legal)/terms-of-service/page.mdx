These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of SoVideo’s website, dashboard, APIs, and any related services (collectively, the “Service”).

## 2. Eligibility

## 3. SoVideo Service Description

SoVideo provides:

- Text-to-video and image-to-video generation powered by the Sora2 API
- Advanced controls such as aspect ratio, duration, negative prompts, and seeds

You retain ownership of the prompts, reference files, and outputs you create, subject to your compliance with these Terms.

## 4. Account Registration & Security

1. **Account Creation**: You must provide accurate and complete information. Using another person’s details without permission is prohibited.
2. **Credentials**: Keep your password and API keys confidential. You are responsible for all activity conducted through your credentials.
3. **Notification Duties**: Notify us immediately at [support@sovideo.ai](mailto:support@sovideo.ai) if you suspect unauthorized access or security incidents.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Violate applicable laws, regulations, or rights of third parties

- Use generated media for deceptive or malicious purposes, including impersonation or disinformation

We reserve the right to investigate and disable accounts that engage in prohibited conduct.

## 6. Intellectual Property

- Credits, subscription plans, and usage limits are described in your account dashboard. Unused credits may expire as stated in the plan details.
- All charges are billed through trusted payment processors. You authorize us to charge your selected payment method for recurring fees until you cancel.
- Except where required by law, payments are non-refundable.

## 8. Confidentiality & Data Protection

We handle submitted prompts, assets, and generated clips in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy). You must not use the Service to transmit sensitive personal data where legal compliance would require enhanced safeguards unless you have appropriate agreements in place.

## 9. Service Availability & Modifications

We strive to keep SoVideo available 24/7, but outages may occur due to maintenance, updates, or factors beyond our control. We may modify or discontinue features with notice where reasonable. Critical updates may require immediate deployment to maintain security or compliance.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, pose a risk to the Service, or fail to pay fees. You may cancel at any time from your account settings. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends, and we may delete stored prompts or outputs in accordance with our retention policy.

## 11. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” SOVIDEO AND ITS LICENSORS (INCLUDING SORA2) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT GENERATED CONTENT WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR BE FREE OF ERRORS OR ARTIFACTS.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SOVIDEO AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO SOVIDEO IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 13. Indemnification

You will indemnify and hold harmless SoVideo, its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claim, loss, liability, and expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from: (a) your use of the Service; (b) content or outputs you create; or (c) your breach of these Terms or violation of law.

## 14. Governing Law & Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute that cannot be resolved informally shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware, following the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Nothing prevents either party from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

## 15. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms to reflect new features, legal requirements, or policy changes. We will provide notice of material updates via email or prominent in-app messaging. Continued use of the Service after the effective date of updated Terms constitutes acceptance.
